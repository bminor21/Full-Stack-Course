        In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms
        and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a
        hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

        It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the
        exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel
        without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and
        lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats — the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on,
        going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill — The Hill, as all the people for many miles
        round called it — and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No
        going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had
        whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on
        the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only
        ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden, and meadows beyond, sloping
        down to the river
